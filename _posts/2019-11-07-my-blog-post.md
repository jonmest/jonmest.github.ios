title:  "My first real blog post"

Hello everyone! My name's Jon and I'm the writer of this blog. As of this day, I've been a student for roughly 2 months. And I've had enough time to form an initial impression of the world of software development and programming.

JavaScript seems like a shockingly versatile language which can be used for client-side programming, simple scripting and back-end applications running on Node.js. Albeit I've ran into programmers who dislike JavaScript for some of its quirks - that I'm not going to comment on myself - I believe its the very versatility of JavaScript which has made it so popular.

It's stunningly convenient to use the same programming language on both the front-end and back-end. Not only that, it's pleasing, in a way, to remain in the same eco-system.

However, I find the environment surrounding JavaScript programming slightly puzzling. For example, when I've ran into problems and searched for information online... a lot of programmers suggest that you install yet another library instead of solving the problem yourself.

For some situations, it may be understandable. You may not have the time to develop a web server from scratch. But some of these libraries solve problems that could be fixed with a couple of minutes of vanilla JavaScript programming, at least if you have the very foundational programming knowledge which I've now acquired.

I'm aware the following example is not a fair representation of the whole JavaScript community, but sometimes it's more interesting to look for the extremes:

Exhibit 1: A vastly popular npm package with 2 contributors, 1 dependency, 13 dependents, and 75,000 weekly downloads.

It's purpose?

To see if a number is even.

It may be an attempt at parody, but it still rocks tens of thousands of downloads every week. 

Quite strange, isn't it?
