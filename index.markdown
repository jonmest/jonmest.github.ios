<p>
My name is Jon Mester and I'm currently a student in the Software Development and Operations programme at Linnaeus University in Sweden. As you may understand, I'm learning skills related to computer science and this website is the product of that.
</p>
<p>
As a part of my examination, this blog will consist of information about me as well as a blog section you can find in the navigation above.

<h2>
Who is Jon Mester?
</h2>
<p>
I'm a student interested in computer science. I'd like to learn more about software development and everything related to system administration and things of that nature, in order to build a more DevOps-focused skillset.

<p>
Have a good day!
